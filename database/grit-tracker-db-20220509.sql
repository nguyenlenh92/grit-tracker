HIST 422	101991	Seeing and Obscuring: Documenting America in the Modern Era, 1877-1945	3	For some Americans, the broad transformations that led to the emergence of modern America inspired great optimism and encouraged innovation. For others, changes in American habits and values inspired fear and nostalgia. Interestingly, both reactions can be found underneath a broad cultural trend prevalent during this period: the impulse to define, document, and interpret an authentic American culture. This seminar style American history class will examine this trend, training students to think about the ways in which four specific forms of cultural production –photography, preservation, tourism/spectacle, and documentary film –shaped Americans’ collective identity and continue to impact our sense of who we are as a nation.

PHIL 453	102868	The Ethics of Aggregation	3	This course looks closely at ethical decisions involving trade-offs, where each decision has a cost, as in the case of a runaway trolley that is going to kill people no matter what you do, but you can decide how many. In such cases should we always do the thing that saves the most lives, or is it unfair to think that the numbers alone determine the ethical issue? Are all lives worth the same, and does this force us to think that only the numbers count? Recommended Preparation: PHIL 150, PHIL 152, PHIL 350, or PHIL 355.	2022-05-10 02:29:03.668+00	2022-05-10 02:29:03.668+00

PHIL 473	102509	Self-Knowledge	3	We seem to know the contents of our own minds – our sensations, thoughts, beliefs, meanings, intentions, emotions – in a way quite different from, and far more secure than, our knowledge of the external world. Some philosophers have concluded that self-knowledge does not depend on either knowledge or the existence of the external world. This course looks at attempts to account for this peculiar feature of the mind as well as its relation to the external world.  Recommended Preparation: One 300-level course in philosophy, especially PHIL 371, PHIL 373, or PHIL 380.	2022-05-10 02:29:03.675+00	2022-05-10 02:29:03.675+00
PHIL 474	102512	Possible Worlds	3	There are numerous ways the world might have been different. Possible worlds provide a way of making sense of this. For every way the world might be there is purported to be a possible world that is that way. Possible worlds have been introduced primarily to deal with modal notions, such as necessity and possibility, but they have also proved fruitful in dealing with a number of other philosophical issues, such as the nature of properties, propositions, causation, laws, and counterfactuals. This course will look at various accounts of what possible worlds are and how they can be used to address various philosophical issues.

PHIL 477	102591	Minds, Machines, and Logic	3	This course looks closely at the computational theory of mind, which holds that the human mind is a mechanical device that translates experience into representations and then operates on these representations according to their mechanical properties in order to produce thought and behavior. Topics to be considered in evaluating this theory include: the nature of intentionality and representation, the nature and limits of models, the coherence of self-reference, the ambiguity of rules, and the social dimension of concepts. Recommended Preparation: One 300-level course in philosophy, especially PHIL 371, PHIL 373, or PHIL 380.	2022-05-10 02:29:03.679+00	2022-05-10 02:29:03.679+00

What does evolutionary theory imply about groupings of individuals? Can evolutionary theory be used to explain social, ethical, or psychological phenomena? Prior knowledge of evolutionary theory is not required. Recommended Preparation: One 300 level course in philosophy, especially PHIL 372 ,PHIL 394 .	2022-05-10 02:29:03.68+00	2022-05-10 02:29:03.68+00
PHIL 479	102514	Paradoxes	3	The course will examine some of the central paradoxes that have and continue to puzzle philosophers. A classic example of a paradox is the liar’s paradox: ‘This sentence is false.’ If it is true, then it is false; if it’s false, then it’s true. Paradoxes have not only led to puzzlement, but also to revolutions in thought about various philosophical issues, such as the nature of truth, meaning, metaphysics, knowledge, and space and time. Amongst the paradoxes the course will consider are logical paradoxes (such as the liar’s paradox), paradoxes of space and time, paradoxes of meaning, and paradoxes of knowledge.

POLI 470	101873	Politics of Human Rights	3	The term “human rights” has become an incredibly powerful one in international relations, used as everything from a justification for support of a given country to an excuse for war against one. But “human rights” is more than a catch-all phrase differentiating the “good” from the “bad” in this world. It is a set of commonly recognized norms and laws that have evolved over hundreds of years. It is a system of international, regional and domestic enforcement mechanisms. And it is an increasingly important part of Western states’ self-identities and foreign policies. The purpose of this course is to explore what human rights are, how they have evolved, and how they influence the international and domestic political arenas. Recommended Preparation: POLI 260, POLI 280 	2022-05-10 02:29:04.095+00	2022-05-10 02:29:04.095+00
POLI 471	101872	Globalization and Transitional Justice	3	In this course we analyze transitional justice, the process by which political elites in post-repressive states account for human rights violations orchestrated by their predecessors. When and under what conditions do newly empowered political leaders choose to confront past abuses and what are the mechanisms they have at their disposal? Why do some new leaders choose to close the past with a one-line condemnation, while others establish a year-long truth commission and still others initiate a decade of criminal prosecutions? This class focuses on the political, rather than judicial, side of transitional justice, taking into account the elite calculus of risk and advantage inherent in the variety of policies political leaders have at their disposal.

POLI 474	101993	Democratization	3	In this course, we explore the theory behind, and the policy questions surrounding, democratization. We begin this class by considering the outstanding traits of democracies and their alternatives, and looking at various theories that help account for why some states democratize and others do not. Next, we consider democratization from the viewpoint of the citizen in non-democratic states. In this section, we look both at the role of the masses and that of counter-elite activists as they seek to weaken the non-democratic state and replace it with a democratic alternative. Since these actors are frequently assisted by outside states, and especially the United States, we subsequently consider the pros and cons of democracy assistance. Finally, this class looks at the various conundrums common to democratizing states, ranging from choosing appropriate institutional mechanisms to the process of dealing with past human rights abuses and abusers.
